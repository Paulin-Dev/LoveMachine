# Love Machine

A **Quiz Application** using Face Detection.

Detects up to 2 faces with a webcam. By pressing the space bar, a new quiz containing 5 questions starts. For each question, two possible answers: one on the left and the other one on the right. The 2 players must move to one of these sides to indicate their answer. If they are on the same side, they win a point. At the end, an emoji appears on their face according to their score.
